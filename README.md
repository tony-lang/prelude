# Tony Prelude

This repository is home to the standard library of the Tony programming language.

Tony is a functional, strongly typed, high level, general purpose programming language. Tony employs refinement types, allowing its type checker to catch domain-specific bugs at compile time.

Other core components of Tony can be found through the following links:

* [Formal specification](https://github.com/tony-lang/spec)
* [Compiler and Type Inference algorithm](https://github.com/tony-lang/tony)
* [CLI](https://github.com/tony-lang/cli)

## Installation

The `tony-prelude` package is published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tony-prelude).

You may install it

* using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (preferred)

    ```
    $ yarn global add tony-prelude
    ```

* or using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm)

    ```
    $ npm install -g tony-prelude
    ```

## Usage

The prelude is imported automatically in all Tony programs. If you wish to override the default import add the following import:

```tn
import { + } from 'prelude'
```

In the above example only `+` is imported from the prelude.

## Development

To start development you first have to fork this repository and locally clone your fork.

Use `yarn start` to listen to changes and rebuild dynamically.

### Testing

To run the tests:

    $ yarn test

To let TypeScript check types:

    $ yarn tsc

The linter can be run as follows:

    $ yarn lint

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for automated code formatting:

    $ yarn prettier

You can find all commands run by the CI workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
